# Cafe Website

Welcome to the **Cafe Website** project! This is a web application designed to help users discover and explore cafes that are suitable for working remotely, especially for those who prefer working from cafes with their laptops.

## Features

- **Cafe Listings:** Browse a variety of cafes with detailed information including location, ambiance, and facilities.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Easy Navigation:** Users can easily navigate between different pages to find cafes that suit their preferences.
- **Admin Control:** Only the admin can delete cafes from the website.

## Admin Access

- **Admin Email:** `admin@admin.com`
- **Password:** `admin`

The admin has exclusive access to delete cafes from the listings. Other users can browse and view cafes, but only the admin has the authority to remove them.
